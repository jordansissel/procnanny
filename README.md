babysit your processes.

NOTE: This project is moving away from javascript. Nodejs is missing many
features that make doing a proper babysitter difficult.

## Mini-FAQ

Why is this in node.js?  Because I hate myself.

Why do you use coffeescript? Because I hate you; also because compiling is fun.

Is this trollware?  Probably.

What else? If I find node.js sufficiently annoying (as I am likely to do), I
will abandon this effort.
